# fullstack_developer_capstone

## Project Overview

This repository contains the **Full-stack Development Capstone Project**, where I acted as a full-stack developer for a **Cars Dealership** system in the U.S. This project demonstrates the ability to build, deploy, and manage a responsive web application using modern full-stack technologies, microservices, and cloud deployment practices.

The application allows users to:

- View dealership branches and products
